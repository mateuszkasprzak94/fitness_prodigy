    """1.	Structural Support: Proteins are the primary components of our cells, tissues, and organs. They provide structural support and maintain the integrity of these structures.

2.	Enzymes: Many proteins act as enzymes, which are biological catalysts. Enzymes facilitate chemical reactions in the body, making processes like digestion, metabolism, and cellular respiration possible.

3.	Hormones: Certain proteins, such as insulin and growth hormone, act as hormones. Hormones regulate various physiological processes, including growth, metabolism, and the body's response to stress.

4.	Transport: Some proteins, like hemoglobin, are responsible for transporting molecules, such as oxygen in the blood.

5.	Immune Function: Antibodies are specialized proteins that play a key role in the immune system by recognizing and neutralizing foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses.

6.	Muscle Contraction: Proteins like actin and myosin enable muscle contractions, making movement possible.

7.	Regulation of pH: Buffering proteins help maintain the body's acid-base balance.

•	Animal Sources: Lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products are excellent sources of high-quality protein.
•	Plant Sources: Legumes (beans, lentils), tofu, tempeh, and certain whole grains (such as quinoa) are plant-based protein sources.
•	Nuts and Seeds: Almonds, chia seeds, and pumpkin seeds are rich in protein.

•	Muscle Growth and Repair: Adequate protein intake is important for building and repairing muscle tissue. This is particularly important for athletes and those engaging in regular physical activity.
•	Satiety: Protein can help you feel full and satisfied, which may aid in weight management and appetite control.
•	Immune Function: Proteins are essential for a well-functioning immune system.
•	Enzymatic Reactions: Enzymes, made up of proteins, catalyze various chemical reactions in the body.

The recommended daily intake of protein can vary depending on factors like age, sex, activity level, and overall health. However, a general guideline is that around 10-35% of daily caloric intake should come from protein sources.
It's important to note that a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of protein sources will help ensure that you obtain all essential amino acids.
Including high-quality protein in your diet is essential for overall health, so be mindful of your protein intake to support your body's functions and wellbeing.

3.	Metabolic Regulation: Carbohydrates play a role in regulating metabolism, preventing the breakdown of protein for energy and aiding in fat metabolism.
