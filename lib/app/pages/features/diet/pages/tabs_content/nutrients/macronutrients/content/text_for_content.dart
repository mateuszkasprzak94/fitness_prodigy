2.	Enzymes: Many proteins act as enzymes, which are biological catalysts. Enzymes facilitate chemical reactions in the body, making processes like digestion, metabolism, and cellular respiration possible.

3.	Hormones: Certain proteins, such as insulin and growth hormone, act as hormones. Hormones regulate various physiological processes, including growth, metabolism, and the body's response to stress.

4.	Transport: Some proteins, like hemoglobin, are responsible for transporting molecules, such as oxygen in the blood.

5.	Immune Function: Antibodies are specialized proteins that play a key role in the immune system by recognizing and neutralizing foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses.

6.	Muscle Contraction: Proteins like actin and myosin enable muscle contractions, making movement possible.

7.	Regulation of pH: Buffering proteins help maintain the body's acid-base balance.

3.	Metabolic Regulation: Carbohydrates play a role in regulating metabolism, preventing the breakdown of protein for energy and aiding in fat metabolism.
